Description of Following Collection

What the Data is...

The following curated repository contains a series of high resolution images utilized for architectural
elevations and rendered images commonly utilized within my main studio courses. The collected data represents
a small portion of my overall digital repository for architectural rendering. This gallery of images are characterized as 
being commonly used within "Site" Plans and/or diagrams. It will contain a series of JPG and PNG data points 
with the following fields: 

Schema.org (Technical Focus)

- Size (Dimension by Pixel width x height)
- Content Size (Size of File by KB or MB)
- Date Modified (File last opened/manipulated in Software)

VCA 4.0 (Art Focus)

- Image ID (Name with Specific Schema)
- Style (Vector or Realism)
- Subject (Controlled Series of Possible Objects)

Image ID Schema...

The following describes the possible groupings of IDs to create a consistent schema format across all files. 
The following structure and components are presented below:

(Segment 1)_(Segment 2)_(Segment 3)

Ex:) V_TS_section-symbol

Segment 1:
- Determines whether the image is a vector image or is based off of realistic principles.
- Utilized singular initial capital with (V = Vector) and (R = Realism)

Segment 2:
- Determines the subject category of the image based off of typical architectural practice and representation.
- The following are possible subject categories with their respective acronym within instantiated schema.
  - Graphic Symbols (Segment = GS)
  - Plants in Elevation (Segment = PE)
  - Top of Plants (Segment = TP)
  - Technical Symbol (Segment = TS)

Segment 3:
- Cusomizabe section of schema that is personalized to each image.
- Only contraint is the removal of odd characters and the replacement of spaces with highphens.
